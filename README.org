** Description

   For the most part, this is a rewrite of Higan in D.

   The following libraries are used:

   - SDL2 :: Backend for the input, audio and video systems.
   - OpenGL :: Framebuffer and post-process effects.
   - Lua :: Scripting, most high-level native code is exposed.
   - Dear IMGUI :: Immediate-mode GUI, available to scripts.
   - libnfd :: Native file dialogs. (ex: open/save file)
   - linenoise :: Used to enter commands at the console.

** History

   The project started when I wanted to learn more about SNES assembly, shortly
   after deciding I also wanted to understand the hardware. This had quickly
   escalated to me thinking "writing an emulator, how hard can it be?"

   Pretty darn hard it turns out.

   After looking at 65816 references and the sources of bsnes, snes9x and zsnes
   while trying to put something together, I quickly had something that could
   more or less load a simple LoROM image. It wasn't long before I discovered
   about properly executing instructions on multiple chips simultaneously...

   Also I found about Higan, the new name for bsnes as a multi-platform emulator.
   Since I mostly want to learn, I decided it would be a fun challenge to port
   it to the D language.
